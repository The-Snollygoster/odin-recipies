    <p><h2>This pasta recipe takes a little work, but it is so satisfying and filling that it's worth it!</h2></p>
    <p>Five cheese ziti al forno is a delicious pasta bake made with ready-made marinara and alfredo sauces, Italian cheese blend, 
        ricotta, ziti, and topped with panko bread crumbs and Parmesan.</p>
    <p>This copycat Olive Garden five cheese ziti al forno is “a cheater recipe,” according to recipe developer and test kitchen expert Juliana Hale. 
        “The jarred sauces and cheese blend make it super easy, but no one else will know that. It’s so good!”</p>

    <h2><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Pasta:</b> This recipe starts with a pound of dry ziti pasta.</li>
        <li><b>Cheeses:</b> It should come as no surprise that you’ll need plenty of cheeses for this dish: A package of shredded 
            Italian blend cheeses, a cup of ricotta, and grated Parmesan. </li>
        <li><b>Jarred sauce:</b> Using jarred sauce cuts down on time — but, of course, you can make your own marinara and Alfredo sauces!</li>
        <li><b>Bread crumbs:</b> Use store-bought or homemade seasoned bread crumbs.</li>
        <li><b>Butter:</b> You’ll need two tablespoons of melted butter for the rich topping. </li>
        <li><b>Garlic:</b> Flavor the buttery bread crumb topping with fresh garlic. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>STEPS</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and drain the pasta.</li>
        <li>Toss the pasta with the sauces, half of the Italian blend cheeses, and ricotta.</li>
        <li>Transfer the mixture to the prepared dish and top with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Make the topping and sprinkle it over the pasta.</li>
        <li>Bake the five cheese ziti al forno until bubbly and golden.</li>
    </ol>
